# stanford-machine-learning

This project contains solutions to the [Stanford Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) 
course exercises implemented with [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/). The scikit-learn 
machine learning library provides optimized implementations for all algorithms presented in the course and needed in 
the course exercises. 

This repo is inspired from [keasserm ml repo](https://https://github.com/krasserm/machine-learning-notebooks)
