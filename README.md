# stanford-machine-learning

This project contains solutions to the [Stanford Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) 
course exercises implemented with [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/). The scikit-learn 
machine learning library provides optimized implementations for all algorithms presented in the course and needed in 
the course exercises. Instead of writing low-level [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) code, as required by 
the course, the solutions presented here demonstrate how to use scikit-learn to solve these exercises on a much higher 
level. It is a level that is closer to that of real-world machine learning projects. This project respects the 
[Coursera Honor Code](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209818863-Coursera-Honor-Code) as the presented 
solutions can't be used to derive the lower-level Octave code that must be written to complete the assignments.
